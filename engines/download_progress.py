"""Shared byte-level download progress hook for Coqui-based engines.

Coqui's TTS.utils.manage._download_zip_file (used by both the
github-release and huggingface download paths - i.e. both VCTK and
XTTS-v2 go through this one function) drives its progress purely
through a plain `tqdm` instance, constructed only when progress_bar=True
is passed all the way down from TTS(...). There's no callback parameter
exposed anywhere in that call chain - the download happens several
layers below the TTS() constructor call, with no hook point passed
through. The only way to observe real byte progress without
reimplementing Coqui's entire download+extract+hash-check logic
ourselves is to temporarily swap out the `tqdm` name that module looks
up (as a bare global, at call time - not captured at import time) for
our own subclass that also forwards progress to a caller-supplied
callback, then restore the original afterward.

Usage:
    def on_progress(downloaded_bytes, total_bytes):
        ...  # called from the SAME thread the download runs on -
             # marshal to the main thread (e.g. tkinter's root.after())
             # before touching any widget from here.

    with progress_hook(on_progress):
        TTS(model_name=..., progress_bar=True, gpu=False)

Callback frequency is throttled internally (roughly every 0.5% of the
total, or every 256KB for unknown-size downloads) so this stays cheap
even for XTTS's ~1.8GB file, which would otherwise fire the callback
on every single 1KB chunk Coqui reads - well over a million calls.
