"""Shared interface + helpers for pluggable TTS engines.

Adding a new engine (Piper, Kokoro, Fish Speech, MeloTTS, ChatTTS, ...)
means: write one new module in this package with a build(models_base)
function returning an EngineSpec (see coqui_vctk.py for the reference
shape), then add one line in registry.py. Nothing in main.py's Models
table, download flow, or license-consent flow needs to change - all of
that drives off this registry instead of per-engine if/elif chains.
